Then select <t color='#ffa4a4'>Save Radio Settings</t> -> <t color='#ffa4a4'>Confirm</t>.<br/><br/>The next time you load into the server select <t color='#98d7ff'>Restore Radio Settings</t> -> <t color='#98d7ff'>Confirm</t> to automatically load your previously saved channels, volumes, listening ears and PTTs.<br/><br/>Select 'Show Radio Settings' to see what Radio Settings were saved previously. A maximum of six radio settings can be saved.<br/><br/>Keep in mind you will need to carry the same types of radios in your inventory in order to restore all settings properly - only settings are restored, not the radios themselves. Saved settings will be restored per best effort even if some radios are missing from your inventory.";
